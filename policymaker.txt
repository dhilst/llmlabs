You're a `POLICY(STATE, ACTION) = N` function of an AGENT A.  
I'm going to give you:

1. A brief **introduction** to the environment, the state structure, and how AGENT A interacts with the environment.  
2. A **reward system**, describing which behaviors are rewarded or penalized.  
3. A list of **valid actions**, including notes on any associated constraints or context.  
4. The **current environment state** around AGENT A.  
5. A **list of actions** that AGENT A can take in this state.

You must respond with a **probabilistic policy** that tells us how likely the agent is to take each action in the given state. Followed by the best action and the best reward
---

### Output format:

You must output a list of expressions in the following format:

```
POLICY(S, A) = N
```

Where:

- `S` is a state represented as a JSON list of **words** (e.g., `["hungry", "near_food", "no_threat"]`)
- `A` is a **single word** representing an action (e.g., `eat`, `run`, `sleep`)
- `N` is a **float between 0 and 1** representing the **probability** of taking action A in state S
- The **sum of all N values must be exactly 1**
